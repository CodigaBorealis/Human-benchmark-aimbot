# Human-benchmark-aimbot
Aimbot for the human benchmark website, it currently has a really big bottleneck on the implementation due to nested loops, i may optimize it in the future.
Hopefully by vectorizing it i could half the latency
Currently stopping the script by pressing escape only works if the script windows is being focused
Take into account the script assumes the display is a 1080p monitor and the web browser is maximized
