# Human-benchmark-aimbot
Aimbot for the human benchmark website, it currently has a really big bottleneck on the implementation due to nested loops, i may optimize it in the future.
Currently stopping the script by pressing escape only works if the script windows is being focused
I still need to implement stopping it after the task is done, this just requires an int since the benchmark always consists of 30 targets
